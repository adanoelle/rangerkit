# RangerKit

🌲🗺️ A companionable toolkit for explorers of code and cloud.

RangerKit is a living DevOps toolkit designed around stewardship, storytelling, and modular spirit companions.

## Spirits
- **Lantern Spirit** — Illuminates unseen trails (debugging helpers).
- **Waystone Spirit** — Maps the living constellation of your infrastructure.
- **Listening Stones** — Whisper gentle health alerts when the wind changes.

Each spirit carries abilities. Each ability is a small blessing.
