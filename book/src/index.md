# Welcome to RangerKit

ðŸŒ² A companionable toolkit for explorers.

Here, tools are not dead machinery â€”  
they are living companions.

Here, the forest remembers every trail walked.

Here, spirits walk beside you:  
Lanterns to light unseen paths,  
Waystones to map forgotten stars,  
Listening Stones to whisper when the winds change.

> *The trail is open.  
> The lanterns are lit.  
> Walk softly. Walk bravely.*
