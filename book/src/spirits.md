# Meeting the Spirits

ðŸŒ¿ In RangerKit, tools are not lifeless.

Every tool, every helper, every trail-watcher is a spirit:  
a living companion who travels the trails with you.

Spirits carry abilities.  
Spirits remember the paths you walk.  
Spirits whisper guidance when you lose your way.

# Listening Stones _(Soon...)_

ðŸ”µ Glyph: `o`

Deep in the woods, there are stones that listen.

They hear the tremble of changes in the wind,  
the hush before a storm,  
the first stirrings of a distant alarm.

The Listening Stones will soon join your trail...
