# Devlog Entry: 0001 â€” First Spirits Commune

_ðŸŒ² Date: 2025-04-28_

## Trail Walked Today
- Fixed early workspace structure issues (crates/ reorganization, Git issues).
- Completed clean Rust module split:
  - Spirit
  - Ability
  - SpiritManifest
- Added beautiful detailed Rust docstrings to all core structures.
- Set up first functional `rangerkit` CLI binary:
  - `spirits` subcommand
  - `commune` sub-subcommand
- Implemented `--format text|json` output:
  - Pretty colored human-readable output
  - Structured JSON output for Nushell
- Successfully piped JSON output into a Nushell dataframe.
- Prepared for transition from raw ANSI codes to `nu-ansi-term`.
- Confirmed clean GitHub repo setup and pushed first public trailhead commit.
- Generated full hackathon `CHECKLIST.md` trail map.
- Made plans for spirit summoning system.

---

## Small Wins
- First successful `cargo run` showing friendly spirits!
- Successfully integrated `clap` parsing cleanly.
- Confirmed `cargo build` produces `rangerkit` binary, not `rangerkit-cli`.
- First live commune with spirits on the CLI!
- First gentle structured data flow between RangerKit and Nushell.

---

## Lessons or Insights
- Breaking early into modular files (`ability.rs`, `spirit.rs`, etc.) makes the entire future trail easier to walk.
- Using `--format json` early makes RangerKit *play nicely* with structured shells like Nushell from the beginning.
- `clap` + `serde_json` + `nu-ansi-term` will be a perfect minimal foundation for soft and powerful CLI interactions.
- Dreaming of spirits (Waystones, Lanterns, Listening Stones) makes the CLI feel *alive* instead of mechanical.

## Forest Notes
> *Tonight the forest answered.  
> The first lanterns were lit,  
> the first spirits gathered,  
> and the trailhead is now a place in memory.*

## Next Trail Markers
- [ ] Integrate `nu-ansi-term` for softer, richer coloring.
- [ ] Create `spirits summon <spirit-name>` system.
- [ ] Handle spirit lookup and ability listing during summon.
- [ ] Add random spirit "whispers" on commune/summon.
- [ ] Sketch early design of Waystone Star Map TUI.
