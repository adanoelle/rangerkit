# Devlog Entry: 0002 â€” The Spirits Gather

_ðŸŒ² Date: 2025-04-28_

## Trail Walked Today
- Modularized CLI structure cleanly using `clap` and `anyhow`.
- Added full `spirits summon` and `spirits commune` commands.
- Successfully piped `commune` output as structured JSON into Nushell.
- Built first TUI for `spirits commune` using `ratatui` and `crossterm`.
- Rendered spirits (Lantern Spirit, Waystone Spirit) inside a soft framed box.
- Implemented graceful key-based TUI exit (Enter or q).
- Added full error context propagation with `anyhow::Context`.
- Cleaned up all cargo warnings for a fully clean build.
- Prepared for future spirit expansions (whispers, animations, maps).

---

## Small Wins
- Corrected careful Result handling through all CLI branches.
- Modularized TUI into its own `tui/` module.
- Softened visual CLI output with `nu-ansi-term` plans.
- Laid foundation for a future animated, breathing RangerKit interface.

---

## Lessons or Insights
- Every layer of modularity (tui/, commune.rs, spirit.rs) made the whole project feel breathable and expandable.
- Early investment in `anyhow` error handling paid off in keeping flow natural.
- TUI experiences feel more alive when they match the spirit of the CLI metaphors.
- **Small careful steps** with Result types and propagation made the final flow clean, graceful, and error-proof.

> *Tonight the spirits gathered.  
> The fire was lit.  
> The forest listened.  
> And the trail is no longer empty.*

- [ ] Begin animating TUI elements gently (pulsing glyphs, breathing stars)
- [ ] Add ability selection for summoned spirits
- [ ] Dream the Waystone Map (infrastructure constellation visualization)
- [ ] Expand the RangerKit Book with TUI guide chapter
